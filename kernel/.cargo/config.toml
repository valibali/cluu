# Cargo Build Configuration for CLUU Kernel
#
# This configuration file tells Cargo how to build the CLUU kernel for a
# bare-metal environment. It enables unstable features necessary for
# kernel development and specifies our custom target.
#
# Why this is important:
# - Enables building Rust's core library from source for our custom target
# - Provides compiler built-ins needed for bare-metal environment
# - Includes memory management functions (memcpy, memset, etc.)
# - Points to our custom target specification
# - Essential for no_std kernel development

[unstable]
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins", "alloc"]
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]

[build]
